# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
Today, we're learning about functions and nested loops. 
## Function
- A function is a block of code that runs when called or it can also be defined as a group of statements that perform a task together. Looking at our former tasks, it is observed that we've been using functions already, main() and printf()are functions. main() is used to executed code while printf() is used to output. To create or declare a function, we require:
- the type.
- the name of the function, and 
- The code to be executed.
e.g `
int functionName()
{
// code to be executed
}`
## Nested Loops
In this lesson, we learnt that loops can also be written inside loops. This is called nested loop. i.e the inner loop is executed one time for each itieration of the outer loop.
We were given 17 tasks to test our knowledge on this, 12 mandatory task and 5 advanced tasks:
### 0. _putchar
### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.
