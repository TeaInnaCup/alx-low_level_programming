# 0x18 - Dynamic Libraries
In this lesson, we're learning about Dynamic Library and how to go about creating one and at the end of this lesson we should be able to explain to anyone:
- What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it?
- What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it?
- What are the differences between static and shared libraries?
- Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig.

## What is a Dynamic Library?
### How to create a dynamic library?
### How does a dynamic library work?
### How to use the dynamic library?

## The environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
### How to use the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

## Differences between Static and Shared Libraries?
| Static Libraries | Shared Libraries |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
|                  |                  |

## Basic usage of:
### `nm`
### `ldd`
### `ldconfig`

## During this project, we were asked to solve 4 tasks:
1. ###  A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
[libdynamic.so]()
[main.h]()

2. ###  Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future 
[1-create_dynamic_lib.sh]()

3. ###  Let's call C functions from Python
[100-operations.so]()

4. ### Code injection: Win the Giga Millions! 
[101-make_me_win.sh]()
